Answer: B
Explanation: If the data used to train an AI model is biased (for example, 
it favors one group over another), the model will learn that bias and produce inaccurate or unfair results.

Q14. "Prompt engineering" is like being a skilled chef. You don't create the ingredients, 
but you know exactly how to combine them and what to add to get the perfect result from a large language model. 
What are the "ingredients" you are providing to the model?
A) The source code for the model
B) The raw data used to train the model
C) The carefully crafted input text (prompts)
